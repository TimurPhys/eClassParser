Hello to everyone who reads this!

Small Description:
This bot parses data from a well-known electronic diary in Latvia for schoolchildren, students and any other students.
It works as simply as possible, the bot is launched on a remote server and makes special Selenium data requests through a browser, by entering your login, password and code from two-factor authentication,
your cookies are successfully saved and the full functionality of the bot opens before you.

What if it doesn't work?
Well, if the online request didn't finish succesfully you will be given a code of error, eventually the best way how to escape it, it is just try one more time till there is no error, because usually such errors are
only connected with browser and problems with browser driver that can be easilly fixed by making another request.

Use my bot with convenience:)
